About the code
Title: CLUES: a method to call multi-size enrichment regions (ERs) from ChIP-Seq data in R
Version: 1
Date: 2017-05-22
Description: This method (CLUES) will identify narrow peaks (NPs) from the input ChIP-Seq, and then cluster 
NPs into short broad enrichment regions (SERs) and long broad enrichment regions (LERs). 
Author: Chao Wu <wuchao1984@zju.edu.cn>, Junling Jia <junlingjia@zju.edu.cn>
Maintainer: Chao Wu <wuchao1984@zju.edu.cn>
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), parallel (3.1.0) and please run the code in linux enviroment because the shell commands are embedded in the code.

#####################################################################################################
What to prepare?

CLUES will call NPs, SERs and LERs from the input ChIP-Seq data with or without control sample.
Please prepare the sorted bed-format reads file (.bed) from single-end ChIP-Sequencing data as input files. 
The sorted bed-format files can be output from standard high throughput sequencing piplelines. 
Here is our pipeline to get the sorted bed-format reads file
"bowtie -S -m 1 -p 20 --solexa-quals -v 2 /public/sequence/genomes/mouse/mm9 $1.fq $1.sam &>$1_mm9.log"
"samtools view -S -b $1.sam -o $1.bam"
"samtools sort $1.bam $1_sorted"
"/public/software_bioinformatics/BEDTools-Version-2.12.0/bin/bamToBed -i $1_sorted.bam >$1_sorted.bed"

We will modify the code and accepts the reads file from pair-end ChIP-Sequencing data as input files in the next version of CLUES.

How to prioritize NPs, SERs and LERs?

	CLUES will prioritize the ERs results (NPs, SERs and LERs) to facilitate users to navigate the potential important sequence motifs, genes and gene-clusters(domains).
	Please put the input ERs (NPs, SERs or LERs) and "CLUES_ranking.R" in the working directory.

	If you decide to prioritize the NPs associated with important sequence motifs, cd in the directory and run the command	
		
	nohup R CMD BATCH "--args NPs_H3K27me3.txt Bymotif NPs_H3K27me3_ranked.txt" CLUES_ranking.R CLUES_ranking.Rout > CLUES_ranking.log &
	
	"LERs_H3K27me3.txt" (input file) is the input NPs file
	"Bymotif" (parameter) is the parameter of prioritization.
	"NPs_H3K27me3_ranked.txt" (output file) is the ranked NPs file
	
	If you decide to prioritize SERs/LERs associated with genes, cd in the directory and run the command	
		
	nohup R CMD BATCH "--args SERs_H3K27me3.txt Bygene SERs_H3K27me3_ranked.txt" CLUES_ranking.R CLUES_ranking.Rout > CLUES_ranking.log &
	
	"SERs_H3K27me3.txt" (or "LERs_H3K27me3.txt") is the input SERs (or LERs) file
	"Bygene"(parameter) is the parameter of prioritization.
	"SERs_H3K27me3_ranked.txt" (output file) is the ranked SERs file

	If you decide to prioritize LERs associated with gene-clusters (domains), cd in the directory and run the command	
		
	nohup R CMD BATCH "--args LERs_H3K27me3.txt Bydomain LERs_H3K27me3_ranked.txt" CLUES_ranking.R CLUES_ranking.Rout > CLUES_ranking.log &
	
	"LERs_H3K27me3.txt" (input file) is the input LERs file.
	"Bydomain" (parameter) is the parameter of prioritization.
	"LERs_H3K27me3_ranked.txt" (output file) is the ranked LERs file

Please see the manuscript for the detail of ranking NPs, SERs and LERs by CLUES.
